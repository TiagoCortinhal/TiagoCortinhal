# 👋 Hi there, I’m Tiago Cortinhal!

🌐 **Researcher in High-dimensional Data Spaces** … with a dash of **philosophy and curiosity!**  

Welcome to my GitHub! Here, you’ll find projects that explore the depths of **multi-modal data fusion** and **semantic scene understanding**. My work dances on the edge of **perception**, **cognition**, and **robust decision-making** for systems that need a keen sense of context.

### 📚 Highlights of My Research:
* **PhD in Data Perception and Synthesis**: My thesis dives into the **fusion of diverse sensory data**, where I tackle challenges like making sense of partial data and understanding complex scenes.
* **[Best PhD Student Paper Award](https://hh.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1849702/FULLTEXT02.pdf)** 🏆: for “Semantics-aware Multi-modal Domain Translation,” exploring ways to make machine understanding more resilient and adaptable.
